# Bangalore House Price Prediction Model üè°

## Short Description
This project uses Machine Learning to predict house prices in Bangalore, India. The model is built using Multiple Linear Regression and is powered by a Streamlit web application for an interactive user experience.

## Features
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values and standardizes data from a real-world housing dataset.

Feature Engineering: Converts categorical data like location into a numerical format using One-Hot Encoding.

Model Training: Trains a scikit-learn Linear Regression model to find the relationship between house features (total area, BHK size, and location) and price.

Model Deployment: Deploys the trained model as a user-friendly web app using Streamlit.

Interactive Interface: Allows users to select a location, BHK size, and total area to get a real-time price prediction.

## Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language.

Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.

Scikit-learn: For building and training the machine learning model.

Streamlit: For creating the interactive web application.

Joblib: For saving and loading the trained model.

NumPy: For numerical operations.
